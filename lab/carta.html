            <h3>Subject of study</h3>
            <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjecs fall somewhere int the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person
                we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we most intriged by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O in to wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30
                    <sup>°</sup>C(86<sup>°</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>>3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li><abbr title="Lenguaje de marcas de hipertexto">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Hojas de estilo en cascada">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So please can you provide more information one each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>

            <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
            <p>Yes, you are rigth! As party of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did study</em> exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dances are a follows, with definitions</p>
            Polynesian chicken dance
            <p class="tabulador">
                A litte knows but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village dance would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock ot be "fruitful".
            </p>
            Icelanding brownian shuffle
            <p class="tabulador">
                Before the Icelanders developers fire as means of getting warm, they used to practiced this dance, witch involved huddling close togueter in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in a impercepably tiny, very rapid movements. One of
                my felow students used to say that he thougth this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
            </p>
            Arctic robot dance
            <p class="tabulador">
                An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960<sub>s</sub> believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska
                and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this beecause they were really could.
            </p>
            <br> For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page.</a>
            <br>
            <br> Yours sincerely.
